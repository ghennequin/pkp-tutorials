    "Neuroscience is studied at a variety of spatial and functional scales: from molecules through single neurons to networks and systems. Decades of combined electrophysiology and theory work at the _cellular level_ have nicely exemplified the type of work that reductionists aim to do: recapitulate complex biological phenomena in a couple of equations, which then form the basis for further studies e.g. at a coarser scale. Thus, we will start our journey in computational neuroscience by taking some time to understand what neurons are, how they respond to messages sent by other neurons, and how they generate their own messages."

    "This notebook is divided into two parts. The first part concerns the famous Hodgkin-Huxley model, covered in lectures. The model is fully implemented in module `Pkp.Neuron.HH`, and you use the Jupyter notebook to explore its behaviour, including the effect of different parameters on the input/output transfer function. The second part concerns reduced models of the “integrate-and-fire” type, which are no longer based on exact biophysics yet capture the response properties of real neurons very accurately. Another objective of this notebook is to progressively ease you into writing more and more complex OCaml code."
