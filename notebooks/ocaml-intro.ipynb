A specific OCaml library providing modules and functions for most of the heavy-lifting (e.g. our tutorial on single neurons will come with a library for the simulation of specific neuron models); those libraries are all bundled in a single library called `pkp` which you can use in your notebooks (`#require \"pkp\"`), and which is [documented online](https://pkp-neuro.github.io/pkp-tutorials/pkp/Pkp/index.html). \n",
